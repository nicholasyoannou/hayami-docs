Hayami can be downloaded and installed straight from the Chrome Web Store. After installation, a new tab will be made guiding you through the setup. This section in the documentation for the meantime will stay blank until the setup process is properly ironed out, since some comments providers have varying "setup" required. I also want to ensure onboarding allows you to make sense of the extension, without being overwhelming at any point.
