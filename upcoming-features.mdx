## 0.1.0 - Planned additions

**Planned new features**

- Themes for Reddit that expands to old-Reddit, to a more traditional layered down-view. This configures the structure of how comments are displayed.
- Expand the current Reddit commenting style so anything beyond 4-5 layers will "paginate" the view back to as-if layer 0, showing a back button to go back to all comments. This allows for more comments to be rendered so it doesn't go off-screen. This could also be done as a popup on-screen and it paginates layers on the popup rather than destroying the full comments view.
- Re-style the edit comment view, dropdowns (top, etc).
- Finish support for icon-inline and others in the manual dropdown.
- Upgrade the backend & extension to support by-date mapping.
- Add "KomentoScript" - a Hayami standard - to add a standard of how other comments sections get embedded into other sites. This'll include where anime names, episode numbers, current episode dates, etc are found. KomentoScript can be synced from a third-party URL, and from Hayami directly for official mappings.

**Patches & fixes**

- Fixes the UI-style editor for how spoilered and other comment types are displayed in-editor.
- Fix the feedback form to support PWA-enlarged display.
- Fix top menu rendering for Hayami on Netflix (scaling for 'Episode Discussion' and other elems).

## Future <u>possible</u> features

- (Possibly) mobile support. Unsure whether this'll come to fruition but put here for now.
- Additions of new discussion platforms:
  - https://bilibili.com (Bangumi Bilibili comments - read-only)
  - https://bilibili.tv (SEA Bilibili - read-only)
  - (Possibly) Bangumi (CN MAL/AL - read-only).
  - (Possibly) https://abema.tv/ (read-only)
- Badges based on how the anime ranked in global charts, taking information from:
  - **Japan**: Amazon Prime Video, Abema, Netflix, dAnimeStore, animehodai, Bandai Channel, and U-NEXT.
  - **Global**: MAL, AniList, Anime Corner, and global streaming sites, if rankings for anime is shown.
- Re-style the manual overwride editor and selector.
