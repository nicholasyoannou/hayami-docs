Hayami Komento brings communities to you, through comments straight underneath anime episodes. Hayami gives you choice on what **platform**, **forum**, and **community** you look at by default. As per the [FAQ on-site](https://hayami.moe/faq), Hayami is a comments aggregator browser extension that shows comments from various platforms in one place. And all for free (unless you wish to [support](/support) the extension).

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a place that properly explains _how_ you use some features, and to explain some things in thorough detail. As per this writing, Hayami is in early beta (which means some features may contain bugs, may break at times, or may be unreliable), so **feedback** is very much appreciated at any point you use the extension. You can provide feedback **through the extension popup** (by clicking the feedback icon at the very top), which allows you to leave feedback anonymously, if you wish, and **also by** [**email**](mailto:hi@hayami.moe).

Currently, Hayami has support for a variety of comments providers, which currently are Reddit, Disqus, MAL, AniList, and YouTube, but it's a continuous growing list and will expand as the extension continually develops over time. Alongside this, Hayami provides some features that aims to enhance your experience using the extension, such as image previews (both on-hover, and on-click for albums) supporting both Imgur and Imgchest (as of current).
