**I'd heavily appreciate - to any and all that use the extension - to leave some feedback.** **Things you dislike, things you want to keep seeing, and features or additions that you think'd be neat.** This allows me to continuously keep making the extension better & allows me to see what should be a focus if things are a tad wacko in some areas.

You can leave feedback in two ways. Via the extension popup: clicking the feedback icon, which'd embed a feedback form off the bat. Or via email at [hi@hayami.moe](mailto:hi@hayami.moe). If you don't wish to be contacted regarding feedback, please indicate so when popping the feedback form by.
