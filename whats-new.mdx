## Version 0.0.7 - Initial closed beta release (CBT)

<Info>
  This is an invite-only CBT to double-check and iron out bugs in Hayami to ensure Hayami is the best it can be at a later stage. If you're interested to try out Hayami, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

**Features**: Includes both unauthenticated & software-app authenticated Reddit versions-rendering of comments, fully-verified commenting functionality on both and introducing an ellipsis menu for editing and deleting comments. Fully-functioning image previews across the board, introducing a guide in the documentation on how to retrieve these keys. Settings on Hayami has been sectioned into categories to account for expanding functionality.

**QOL**: Reddit API will no longer be spam-called in many scenarios in the event a user has placed multiple comments, and lessens calls to update a subreddit data to weekly. 

**To-do**: Work needs to be done around checking whether profile pictures are fetched properly in niche scenarios (u/deleted, both on authenticated and unauthenticated fronts) and why upon skeleton loading, the profile pictures themselves loading in create a padding-like effect on-load-in. MAL logo needs to be updated to the actual logo instead of the placeholder intended for testing.
