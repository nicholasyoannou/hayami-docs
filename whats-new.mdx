<Update label="Version 0.0.7">
  ## Version 0.0.7 - Initial open beta release (OBT)

  <Info>
    This is an open beta release to double-check and iron out bugs in Hayami to ensure Hayami is the best it can be at a later stage. Hayami will be in a non-bug-free state, so I'd appreciate feedback reports.
  </Info>
  **Features**: Includes both unauthenticated & software-app authenticated Reddit versions-rendering of comments, fully-verified commenting functionality on both and introducing an ellipsis menu for editing and deleting comments. Fully-functioning image previews across the board, introducing a guide in the documentation on how to retrieve these keys. Settings on Hayami has been sectioned into categories to account for expanding functionality.

  **QOL**: Reddit API will no longer be called _often _in many scenarios in the event a user has placed multiple comments, and lessens calls to update a subreddit data to weekly.

  **To-do**: Work needs to be done around checking whether profile pictures are fetched properly in niche scenarios (u/deleted, both on authenticated and unauthenticated fronts) and why upon skeleton loading, the profile pictures themselves loading in create a padding-like effect on-load-in. MAL logo needs to be updated to the actual logo instead of the placeholder intended for testing.
