Hayami has a backend that enables the extension to continually keep running. Primarily this is composed of it's server-side mapper & databases that handles the majority of the background mapping work, ensuring your episode matches the corresponding comments post on the anime your watching. But there's more to this I'd love to add, and to continually do so I don't have infinite funding to keep pouring into the project.

To continually expand upon not only the comments providers available, but the kinds of features the extension can provide, [Hayami Plus](https://hayami.moe/plus) continually supports the project and allows myself to continually expand on databases, processing power, and potential other ways to improve features to enable the best possible experience. This costs a buck (\$1 USD) a month (charged in your local currency, not USD). And you can cancel at any point, when you want.

Hayami Plus does not offer anything groundbreaking at the moment other than API-Key rate limits rather than IP-based rate limits, but I do plan to add more features in the future. What this means in lamens terms is if your going from episode to episode rapidly, and someone else on the same network is also doing so (and you share the same IP), you might experience longer loading times. API-Key rate limits means limits are tracked via a uniquely generated token instead, not your IP.
