<Update label="Version 0.0.9" description="Unpublished">
  ## v0.0.9 WIP - New platform & backend additions

  **Features**: Implemented and indexed archived Aniwave comments (thanks to u/Goofhey for the archival work) in the backend database including image assets properly served. Aniwave has been directly added in Hayami as a supported discussion platform and added rendering support for this.

  **TBD**: Change way API sends information on replies to a given top comment, and implement this handling into Hayami. Finish up image serving backend work and clean up database and Hayami to handle this. Do more exhaustive testing around rendering, add a note that Aniwave is for archived comments only.

  ## v0.0.8 WIP - General backend & mapping improvements

  **Features**: Improves backend to support date & by-document-ID mapping improving search. Adds date to background workers to account for date mapping search.

  **TBD**: Confirm date mapping on API, do TODO from v0.0.7. Implement date mapping on _most_ websites on Hayami (excl. Crunchyroll unless after March, 1st 2022 (Funimation catalogue merge [screwed over the dates on-site for older series](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GY3VKX1MR/hunter-x-hunter))).

<Update label="Version 0.0.7" description="Published">
  ## v0.0.7 - Initial open beta release (OBT)

  <Info>
    This is an open beta release to double-check and iron out bugs in Hayami to ensure Hayami is the best it can be at a later stage. Hayami will be in a non-bug-free state, so I'd appreciate feedback.
  </Info>
  **Features**: Includes both unauthenticated & software-app authenticated Reddit versions-rendering of comments, fully-verified commenting functionality on both and introducing an ellipsis menu for editing and deleting comments. Fully-functioning image previews across the board, introducing a guide in the documentation on how to retrieve these keys. Settings on Hayami has been sectioned into categories to account for expanding functionality.

  **QOL**: Reddit API will no longer be called _often_ in many scenarios in the event a user has placed multiple comments, and lessens calls to update a subreddit data to weekly.

  **To-do**: Work needs to be done around checking whether profile pictures are fetched properly in niche scenarios (u/deleted, both on authenticated and unauthenticated fronts) and why upon skeleton loading, the profile pictures themselves loading in create a padding-like effect on-load-in. MAL logo needs to be updated to the actual logo instead of the placeholder intended for testing.
